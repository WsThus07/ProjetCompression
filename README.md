# IRM Image Compression

## Description

IRM Image Compression is a project aimed at developing a new file compression algorithm specifically designed for reducing the size of PNG and JPG images. The project introduces a new file extension, `.irm`, to signify the compressed images.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to address the growing need for efficient image compression techniques that can significantly reduce the file size of images without compromising their visual quality. The traditional compression algorithms used for PNG and JPG files often have limitations in achieving optimal compression ratios. The IRM Image Compression project aims to overcome these limitations and provide a new solution that can achieve higher compression ratios while maintaining image quality.

## Features

- **Lossless Compression**: The IRM compression algorithm is designed to perform lossless compression, ensuring that the original image data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed file.

- **Improved Compression Ratios**: The algorithm employs advanced techniques to achieve higher compression ratios compared to traditional compression methods. This results in significantly reduced file sizes for PNG and JPG images.

- **Preservation of Image Quality**: Despite the high compression ratios, the IRM compression algorithm aims to preserve image quality by minimizing the loss of visual information during the compression process. This allows users to enjoy smaller file sizes without noticeable degradation in image quality.

- **Compatibility**: The project provides tools and libraries to encode and decode IRM compressed images, ensuring compatibility across different platforms and image viewing applications.

## Usage

To compress an image using the IRM compression algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Install the IRM Image Compression software package from the provided repository.

2. Import the necessary libraries or include the required dependencies in your project.

3. Load the image file in PNG or JPG format that you want to compress.

4. Apply the IRM compression algorithm to the image data.

5. Save the compressed image in the new `.irm` file format.

To decompress an IRM compressed image:

1. Load the `.irm` file using the IRM Image Compression software.

2. Apply the decompression algorithm to reconstruct the original image data.

3. Save the decompressed image in the desired format, such as PNG or JPG.
